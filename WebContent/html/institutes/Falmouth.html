Falmouth University (Cornish: Pennskol Aberfala) is a multi-arts university based in Falmouth and Penryn, Cornwall, England. Founded in 1902, it had previously been the Falmouth School of Art, Falmouth College of Art and Design and then Falmouth College of Arts until it received taught degree-awarding powers, and the right to use the title "University College", in March 2005. In April 2008, University College Falmouth merged with Dartington College of Arts, adding a range of Performance courses to its portfolio. On 27 November 2012, a communication was released to the staff and students and local press that 'University College Falmouth is to be granted full university status in a move that will further its ambition to become one of the top five arts universities in the world. On 9 December 2012, the University College was officially granted full university status by the Privy Council. Falmouth University was judged by The Sunday Times to be the UKâ€™s top arts university from 2015-2017.
<br>The university is located in Penryn and Falmouth. Penryn Campus, near the town of Penryn, is the larger of its two campuses, which it operated until 2016 in partnership with the University of Exeter, under the Combined Universities in Cornwall initiative. It is not known why Falmouth University is no longer part of Combined Universities in Cornwall. Falmouth Campus is in Falmouth town centre and provides a historic contrast to the modernity of Penryn.
