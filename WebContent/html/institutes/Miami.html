<p><b>University of Miami Overview:</b><br>
<b>What:</b> University of Miami Music Business and Entertainment degree program<br>
<b>Where:</b> Miami, Florida, USA<br>
<b>Degrees Offered:</b> B.M. and M.A.<br>
<b>Music Business and Entertainment Industries:</b><br> <b>Basic Program Information:</b>
The University of Miami's Music Business and Entertainment Industries degree program is part of the university's Frost School of Music, although students also take many classes in the School of Business.<br><br>
The Frost School of Music also offers a Bachelor's degree in music, but the difference between that degree and the music business degree is that the emphasis in the latter is on preparing students for the business side of the industry. Although students in the music business program still must take classes in music performance and theory, learning the industry is the focus.
<br><b>What Will You Learn?:</b><br>
There is plenty of room within the music degree program for students to develop their own interests, including recording and studio work, management, record label jobs, music promotion, and even teaching music. Although students are able to develop their specialty, they are exposed to all aspects of the music industry so they will be able to see how their chosen field fits into the larger picture.
